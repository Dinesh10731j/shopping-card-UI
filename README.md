# Shopping Card UI
This is a simple shopping card user interface (UI) built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The UI displays three products, each with an image, title, size information, price, and 
quantity control. Users can adjust the quantity of each product using the increment and
decrement buttons. The total products, discounts, delivery charge, and the overall total are also displayed.
